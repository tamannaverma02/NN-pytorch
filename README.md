# Neural Networks with PyTorch ðŸš€

This repository contains implementations of various core neural network architectures using **PyTorch**, each paired with a small, practical application. It serves as a hands-on resource for learning how to build and train Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models from scratch using PyTorch.
